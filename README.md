> ## üìù Notes

> **This is my main account** - I have made a few accounts after this account in order to practice **git* and **GitHub**. Unfortunately, I can't delete those accounts anymore because I forgot my passwords. If you want to check those account ([ritzculanagm](https://github.com/ritzculanagm), and [rvculanag](https://github.com/rvculanag)) feel free to do so, but I don't have that much repos in there.

## üè´ Education

I am currently at 12th grade and graduating (hoping) in the Technical Vocational Livelihood (TVL) track in Mobile App and Web Development. I am planning to take a degree in Computer Science or Information Technology in college.

## üß∞ Skills

Here are a few skills I've obtained while studying Mobile App and Web Development in school.

- **Java** - I've learned a bit of Java as well, the fundamentals such as *data types*, *methods*, and more. I've also built some simple mobile apps using Java.
- **JavaScript** - I've also learned the fundamentals of JavaScript to make my websites more interactive.
